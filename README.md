- Deploy as a web app (frontend + backend)

### Folder Structure:
- `data/`: Raw and processed review data
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration
- `models/`: Trained machine learning models
- `app/`: Backend app code (e.g., Flask/FastAPI)
- `frontend/`: Frontend (e.g., Streamlit/React)
